      <div id="bazar-studios-synopsis">
        <p>
          I joined Bazar Studios almost straight after finishing my Degree at
          SCU starting as a secondary coder and not long after that as the only
          in house coder.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work at Bazar Studios was wide as the company worked primarily as
          an outsourcing company for other agencies, most under NDAs. Work which
          included Flash Ads (both resizes and from design. My work
          predominately on the more interactive ones), HTML Ads (as with the
          flash ads), Flash Sites, Websites (PHP, Straight HTML and CMS based,
          both responsive and not) and EDMs (creating html emails from designs
          that were also responsive). The other main client was with an Adult
          Affiliate Marketing company (GunzBlazing.com) for which I
          made/maintained the approximately 25 sites that they managed (about 6
          pages per site), the main webmaster portal, the promo content for
          webmasters and tools the generate the content from the promo pack
          system using both PHP and Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016 I started using Drupal 7 for new Sites and worked on migrating
          all the sites for the GunzBlazing from an old Mansion CMS, to Drupal 7
          (Drupal 8 modules for relations were not stable at the time), which
          required me to extract the content from the MySQLDB directly as the
          Mansion CMS did not have any export tools. Also for some of these
          sites I implemented Drupal Commerce for the sale of shirts and
          licenses to download videos.
