    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I try to keep myself up to date with all the current front-end libraries
      and frameworks and continually play with code outside of work, subscribing
      to pretty much all of the CooperPress mailing lists, and Egghead.IO
    </p>
    <p>
      My current favourite library/framework of choice is React, as after using
      Knockout and Angular the idea of a DOM system that was all just javascript
      was interesting, and after playing with JSX for a bit, it got me hooked,
      and I am dissapointed that I didn't use it for the two sites I used Vue
      for. At the time I was playing with Vue, and a new tool (Poi) which made
      it simple to run with Vue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a bit of a console gamer as I have a Switch, a PS4 and an XBOX and
      often get hooked on RPGs. I'm looking forward to Kigndom Hearts 3 and
      CyberPunk 2077.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also a bit of a reader and can say I have read all of R. E. Feists'
      Magician books, and I am currently reading his latest book now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also a Referee for Football Far North Coast, and will likely continue
      refereeing football (soccer) wherever I move, as I recently got back into
      this as a method of keeping fit.
