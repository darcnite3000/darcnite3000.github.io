    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I've been working in the web industry for over 11 years and have seen the
      progression from Perl to PHP and from Flash to HTML5 ads, and am still
      interested in the new front end technology coming out. I'm used to rapid
      development, and emergency fixes in getting ads, sites and tools into
      production.
