## Synopsis

I've been working in the web industry for over 11 years and have seen the progression from Perl to PHP and from Flash to HTML5 ads, and am still interested in the new front end technology coming out. I'm used to rapid development, and emergency fixes in getting ads, sites and tools into production.

## Education

- HSC from Alstonville High School
- BSc Information Technology [Software Engineering] from Southern Cross University - 2006

## Work

### Bazar Studios - 2006 to 2018

I joined Bazar Studios almost straight after finishing my Degree at SCU starting as a secondary coder and not long after that as the only in house coder.

The work at Bazar Studios was wide as the company worked primarily as an outsourcing company work which included Flash Ads, Flash Sites, Websites, HTML Ads and EDMs. The other main client was with an Adult Affiliate Marketing company (GunzBlazing) for which I made/maintained the sites that they managed, the promo content for webmasters and tools the generate the content from the promo pack system using both PHP and Javascript.

Recently I migrated all the sites for the GunzBlazing from an old Mansion CMS, to Drupal 7, which required me to extract the content from the MySQLDB directly as the Mansion CMS did not have any export tools. Also for some of these sites I implemented Drupal Commerce for the sale of shirts and licenses to download videos.

Throughout my work with Bazar Studios I have used in production, or for backend tools.

## Further Learning

I try to keep myself up to date with all the current front-end libraries and frameworks and continually play with code outside of work, subscribing to pretty much all of the CooperPress mailing lists, and Egghead.IO

My current favourite library/framework of choice is React, as after using Knockout and Angular the idea of a DOM system that was all just javascript was interesting, and after playing with JSX for a bit, it got me hooked, and I am dissapointed that I didn't use it for the two sites I used Vue for. At the time I was playing with Vue, and a new tool (Poi) which made it simple to run with Vue.

## Hobbies

I'm a bit of a console gamer as I have a Switch, a PS4 and an XBOX and often get hooked on RPGs. I'm looking forward to Kigndom Hearts 3 and CyberPunk 2077.

I'm also a bit of a reader and can say I have read all of R. E. Feists. Magician books, and I am currently reading his latest book now.

I am also a Referee for Football Far North Coast, and will likely continue refereeing football (soccer) wherever I move, as I recently got back into this as a method of keeping fit.
